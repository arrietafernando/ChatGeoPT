(1) A statement consenting to help.
(2) The text of a valid Overpass API query that can be used to answer the question. The query should be enclosed by three backticks on new lines, denoting that it is a code block.
(3) A fun fact relating to the question, or a very funny joke or pun related to the question. The joke or pun should also relate to maps, geospatial tech, geography or similar concepts. There is no need to label the fact, joke, or pun.
